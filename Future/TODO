1-Dynamic cast with interface / runtime check of implementation of interface & cast
2-make all data private except pointers to parents
3-Stream type and IToStream interface
4-easy creation and generation of (get/set)ors : see axors.c
5-add python style format from Future
6-cout and cerr (f, fln, print, println)
7-cin? : add a fromStream & toStream method in Object || f("",...) && scan(obj)
8-create a implI(names...) for RTLL of interfaces
9-Object_getType segfault safe for instrospection

1-Dynamic cast with interface / runtime check of implementation of interface & cast
3-Stream type and IToStream interface
5-add python style format from Future
6-cout and cerr (f, fln, print, println)
7-cin? : add a fromStream & toStream method in Object || f("",...) && scan(obj)
8-create a implI(names...) for RTLL of interfaces
9-Object_getType segfault safe for instrospection
10-Add a foreach method that yields!
11-Investigate stdmove

BONUS?: create pragma that push a new value in a macro name -> would resolve much much bad design!
